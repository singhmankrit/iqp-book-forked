# Degrees of freedom

## Degrees of freedom of light
`[slide]`

To start, we continue with light, we have used the polarization as an example, what else? Frequency or wavelength, the time of light pulses or single photons, or the spatial structure are equally valid degrees of freedom in which we can encode information. In contrast to polarization of a light beam, which only has 2 orthogonal basis vectors, the others are what we call continuous degrees of freedom, therefore we would need to make a discrete and orthogonal basis. Examples are time “bins”, frequency bins, or spatial bins or modes. Important is that in the other cases, we do not only have two basis states, but we can have more – higher-dimensional (d) spaces.

As an interesting side note, in principle one can do universal quantum computation with laser beams – but the amount of optical elements needed scales exponentially with the number of qubits, similar to classical simulation of a quantum computer. You will learn more in other courses, basically, it is the overall dimension of the state space (the vectors before!), or Hilbert space, that counts. This is d^N, where d is the dimension of the single quantum state from before, and N is the number of particles. We can think of a particle as an entity on which we can do measurements.

TODO pics: polarization, positions, frequencies, also more.

## Fundamental particles
`[slide]`

Very important is understanding the quantum behaviour of fundamental particles, they can be controlled on the quantum level in a particularly clear and simple way. We will learn in quantum mechanics about free atoms and electrons, electrons bound to atoms like the hydrogen atom, the angular momentum degree of freedom, in particular the “spin”, of electrons and other fundamental particles.

TODO: Q: name examples of possible systems and degrees of freedom to encode qubits!

TODO: pics of particles

## Composite quantum systems
`[slide]`

But not only fundamental particles show quantum behaviour, also ensembles and composites of different particles can behave quantum mechanically - after having understood how these fundamental particles behave quantum mechanically, we can quite easily also understand the composite systems. Nowadays we can control the quantum state of billions of electrons forming supercurrents in superconducting qubits, control collective acoustic excitations of millions of atoms in crystals, or the vibration of a tiny membrane of an amorphous glassy material.
