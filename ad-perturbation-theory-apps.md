# Applications of perturbation theory

In this section, we give an overview how perturbation theory is used to calculate all kinds of corrections to the very simple hydrogen model that we had discussed before.

Historically and in most books, perturbation theory has been applied to calculate energy levels of atoms with better and better precision - to keep pace with the constantly increasing precision of experimental data - and this race is still on-going.

However, perturbation theory is equally useful for prediction of the behaviour of modern quantum systems that are used as qubits, therefore learning perturbation theory is useful for QIST! Anyway, in this course we will focus on the hydrogen atom.

## Relativistic corrections

`[slide]`

We had seen that the quantum wavefunction of the electron has angular momentum, which also implies linear momentum - and any moving particle with mass $m$ is subject to relativistic corrections. For a point-like particle, the momentum becomes 

$$p=\frac{m v}{\sqrt{1-(v / c)^2}}$$(ad-pta-1)

Calculation of this perturbation theory, luckily the standard non-degenerate theory works due to the nature of the corrections, for details please read Griffiths 7.3.1. The result is:

$$
E_r^1=-\frac{\left(E_n\right)^2}{2 m c^2}\left[\frac{4 n}{\ell+1 / 2}-3\right]
$$(ad-pta-2)

We see that now, the energy levels depend on the angular momentum quantum number $\ell$! The corrections are on the $10^-5$ level to the eigenenergies of hydrogen.

## Spin-orbit coupling

`[slide]`

As we discussed before, particles with spin have a magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}=\gamma\vec{S}$, and if there is a magnetic field it has an energy of $H=-\gamma\vec{B}\cdot\vec{S}$. Where is the issue in hydrogen-like systems without external magnetic fields?

In the rest frame of the proton, there is no magnetic field produced by the proton. However, in the rest frame of the electron, where the proton circles around the electron, it produces a magnetic field known from the [Biot-Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law) in electromagnetism.

The magnetic field is proportional to the angular momentum of the electron: 

$$\vec{B}\propto\vec{L}$$(ad-pta-3)

We obtain as the spin-orbit coupling Hamiltonian this expression - we mainly note that it retains our initial assumption:

$$H_{so}^{\prime}=\left(\frac{e^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0}\right) \frac{1}{m^2 c^2 r^3} \vec{S}\cdot\vec{L}$$(ad-pta-4)

## Quantum spin-orbit coupling

`[slide]`

In the presence of such interaction, you probably agree that $H$ no longer commutes with $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{S}$, and the spin and orbital angular momenta are not separately conserved.

Luckily, $H_{so}$ does commute with $L^2$, $S^2$, and the total angular momentum $\vec{J}=\vec{L}+\vec{S}$. So $L_z$ and $S_z$ became bad states, but the eigenstates of $L^2$, $S^2$, $J^2$, and $J_z$ are "good"! We won't calculate them here, see Griffiths 7.3.2 for more information. The result is:

$$
E_{\mathrm{so}}^1=\frac{\left(E_n\right)^2}{m c^2}\left\{\frac{n[j(j+1)-\ell(\ell+1)-3 / 4]}{\ell(\ell+1 / 2)(\ell+1)}\right\}
$$(ad-pta-5)

The most important outcome is that the energy of the electronic states in hydrogen depend not only on $n$ and $\ell$, but also on the spin via $j$, which therefore splits different $\ell$ and $s$ states:

Historically, the "fine structure" of the hydrogen atom includes the relativistic corrections and spin-orbit coupling, which itself has contributions by a number of effects.

Here is a very useful wikipedia page which sums up very well many decades of research on the fine structure of hydrogen: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure). Effects can work in different directions, as shown in the Figure.

Of course, everything is in excellent agreement with experiments! A note on the existence of "true degeneracies" - probably it's best not to think that they are fundamental, but only due to our level of approximation of a model. For instance, even the energy levels on the right in the figure above are degenerate in $m_j$ - what lifts this last degeneracy?


## The Zeeman effect

`[slide]`

The last degeneracy in $m_j$ is lifted by the Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field, which we have seen before, now with the dipole moment for electron spin $\vec{\mu}_s=-\frac{e}{m} \vec{S}$ and orbital motion $\vec{\mu}_l=-\frac{e}{2 m} \vec{L}$:

$$H_Z^{\prime}=\frac{e}{2 m}(\vec{L}+2 \vec{S}) \cdot \vec{B}_{\vec{ext}}$$(ad-pta-6)

Depending on the strength of the magnetic field compared to the internal magnetic fields that lead to spin-orbit interaction, one distinguishes different regimes: The weak- and strong-field Zeeman effect.

### Weak-field Zeeman effect

`[slide]`

For $B_{\mathrm{ext}} \ll B_{\mathrm{int}}$, the fine structure splitting dominates, and $H_Z'$ can be treated as a perturbation. Luckily, $\left|n \ell j m_j\right\rangle$ are good eigenstates and we can use first-order perturbation theory (for details see Griffiths 7.4.1):

$$E_Z^1=\left\langle n \ell j m_j\left|H_Z^{\prime}\right| n \ell j m_j\right\rangle=\frac{e}{2 m} B_{\mathrm{ext}} \hat{k} \cdot\langle\vec{L}+2 \vec{S}\rangle$$

One can calculate 

$$\langle\vec{L}+2 \vec{S}\rangle=\left[1+\frac{j(j+1)-\ell(\ell+1)+s(s+1)}{2 j(j+1)}\right]\langle\vec{J}\rangle$$

where the term in brackets is the **Land√© g-factor** $g_J$:

$$E_Z^1=\mu_B g_J B_{\mathrm{ext}} m_j$$(ad-pta-7)

And, 

$$\mu_B \equiv \frac{e \hbar}{2 m}=5.788 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{eV} / \mathrm{T}$$(ad-pta-8)

is the **Bohr magneton**, a useful quantity in quantum mechanics.

The magnetic field breaks rotation symmetry and $H_Z'$ lifts the degeneracy in $m$.

### Strong-field and intermediate fields

`[slide]`

If $B_{\mathrm{ext}} \gg B_{\mathrm{int}}$, we can use $H_{\mathrm{Bohr}}+H_Z^{\prime}$ as the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and use $H_{fs}'$ as the perturbation. 

Now, what if spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting are similar? Somehow a theory needs to connect the corrections by the weak- and strong-field Zeeman effect in a continuous way. In this intermediate regime we need to treat $ H^{\prime}=H_Z^{\prime}+H_{\mathrm{fs}}^{\prime}$ as the perturbation, and it is not clear what good eigenstates are. Therefore, we have to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to find the state decomposition, and have to run perturbation theory with them. We do not do this here but it works, as can be seen in Griffiths 7.4.3.

## Hyperfine splitting

`[slide]`

As a last effect, we want to mention the hyperfine splitting, since it appears also in other qubit systems than atoms.

It comes by the magnetic dipole moment of the proton, which is much smaller than the dipole moment of the electron because the proton mass is much higher:

$$
\vec{\mu}_p=\frac{g_p e}{2 m_p} \vec{S}_p, \quad \vec{\mu}_e=-\frac{e}{m_e} \vec{S}_e
$$(ad-pta-9)

We find a first-order perturbation theory correction to energy 

$$E_{\mathrm{hf}}^1=\frac{\mu_0 g_p e^2}{3 \pi m_p m_e a^3}\left\langle\vec{S}_p \cdot \vec{S}_e\right\rangle$$(ad-pta-10)

which is a first example of spin-spin coupling! It is suggestive that it splits the "triplet" state where both spins are aligned parallel, and the singlet state.

It turns out that this energy difference is $1420$ MHz which corresponds to a wavelength of 21 cm. This radiation can easily be detected with radio antennas, and since it can easily be thermally excited, it is one of the key frequencies omnipresent in radiation from the universe, it indicates the presence of hydrogen!
